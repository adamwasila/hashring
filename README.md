Stable hashing implementation in java. Clean and simple (no runtime dependencies!).

Currently it supports two independent algorithms for hashing:

* Consistent hashing

Implementations is heavily inspired (almost translation though refactored now) on golang hashring library https://github.com/serialx/hashring .

* Rendezvous hashing (aka Highest Random Weight or HRW hashing)

Based on python algorithm described here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendezvous_hashing directly implementing idea presented and proved here: http://www.snia.org/sites/default/files/SDC15_presentations/dist_sys/Jason_Resch_New_Consistent_Hashings_Rev.pdf
